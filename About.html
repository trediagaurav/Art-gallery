    <h1>History of Art</h1>
    <p><span>Art history</span> is the study of objects of art in their historical development and stylistic contexts; that is genre, design, format, and style.The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.</p>
    <p>Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability 
    of the written word, but art historians also rely on formal analysis, semiotics, psychoanalysis and iconography. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies 
    have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding context, form, and social significance.</p>
    <p>Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art.
     This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can bimgire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.</p><br>

     <h2>Painting</h2>
     <div>
         <p>Pre-history. The oldest known paintings are approximately 40,000 years old. José Luis Sanchidrián at the University of Cordoba, Spain, believes the paintings are more likely to have been painted by Neanderthals than early modern humans. Images at the Chauvet cave in France are thought to be about 32,000 years old. Some of the famous painting below:</p><br>

     <h2>Sketches</h2>
     <div><p>A sketch (ultimately from Greek σχέδιος – schedios, "done extempore" is a rapidly executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principle.</p>
     <p>Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in clay, plasticine or wax. Some of the sketches are down below:</p></div>
